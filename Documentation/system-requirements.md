# System Requirements to Source-Build

This document provides the system requirements to source build the .NET SDK for a targeted platform.

## Operating System

### Linux

* [Toolchain Setup](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/workflow/requirements/linux-requirements.md#toolchain-setup)
* [Preconfigured Container Images](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-buildtools-prereqs-docker) - These images are used by [CI](https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/release/7.0.1xx/src/SourceBuild/Arcade/eng/common/templates/job/source-build-run-tarball-build.yml#L12-L16) to build and test source-build.
* [Distros Source Building .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build#net-in-linux-distributions)

### MacOS

MacOS is not currently supported: [Tracking Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2909).  However, community users have created a [Homebrew project](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/dotnet.rb) to build .NET for OSX.  Please feel free to open new issues in individual repos or in source-build for OSX issues.

### Windows

Windows is not currently supported. [Tracking Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2910)

## Hardware

### Disk Space

80 GB of space is required for a typical build. You can reduced this down to ~30 GB if you build with the `clean-while-building` option. This might increase over time, so consider this to be a minimum bar.

### Memory

A minimum of 8 GB of memory is recommended.

### Architectures

#### Officially Supported

* ARM64
* x64

#### Community Supported

* ARM32
* s390x
* ppc64le

## Network

The following assets will need to be downloaded in order to build.

* Source: 525 MB
* SDK: 230 MB
* Artifacts
  * .NET 8.0: 1 GB
  * .NET 7.0: 1.2 GB
  * .NET 6.0: 4 GB
