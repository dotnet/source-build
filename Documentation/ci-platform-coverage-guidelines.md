# Guidelines for Platforms Tested in CI

This document contains the guidelines for which platforms (OS and architectures)
to test in the source build CI.

## Distro Families

1. Prefer testing base distros of families over derivatives.
1. Prioritize testing distros that source build .NET.
1. Use CentOS Stream instead of Red Hat because it is the free alternative.
1. Include a permutation of distros for the supported C standard library
implementations (e.g. glibc and musl).
1. For each C standard library implementation, include at least one distro that
uses the minimum supported version of this library.
1. Only test [distros that are officially supported by
.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md#net-supported-os-policy).
Community supported distros will not be covered.

## Distro Versions

1. Prefer testing latest LTS version. If LTS is unsupported, use the latest
   version instead.
1. Drop distro versions that will be or are nearing EOL on the .NET release day.
1. Stop updating the test matrix in the last 6 months of support for a .NET
version as new distro versions are released.

## Architectures

1. Amd64
1. Arm64

## Permutations

It is not the intent to test every permutation of distro family, distro version,
and architecture. Rather, smart decisions should be made to best utilize
resources.

The following distro versions will be included in the [CI
matrix](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/eng/pipelines/templates/stages/vmr-build.yml):

1. CentOS Stream - Latest version (amd64)
1. Fedora - Latest version (amd64)
1. Ubuntu - Latest LTS version at the time of the release (amd64/arm64)
1. Alpine - Latest version (amd64)
1. AlmaLinux - Oldest version (targets lowest glibc version) (amd64)

## Updating Distro Versions in the VMR

There are two scenarios when updating distro versions in the CI pipeline:

### Case 1: OS Leg in VMR Produces N-1 artifact (Previous Version Support)

When updating a distro that produces an N-1 (previous version) artifact in the VMR:

1. **Update VMR pipeline variables:**
   - Create "Previous" versions of existing distro variables by adding `Previous` suffix to preserve the old values
   - Update current distro variables to new version values

1. **Update VMR pipeline:**
   - Add container configuration for previous version
   - For previous legs, update the distro parameters to use the previous variables you created in Step 1.

1. **Update SBRP Cleanup pipeline:**
   - If applicable, update the default artifact name in the source-build-reference-packages clean up pipeline - [example](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages/pull/1284)

1. **File a tracking issue** to remove the previous variables and update the artifact RID used in `prep-source-build.sh` - [example](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/5238)

1. **Submit and test your changes:**
   - Open a pull request with all changes - [example](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/pull/1093)
   - Queue a full build of the VMR to validate the changes

1. **Update release pipelines:**
   - Update the artifact name for relevant .NET version in the source-build release and re-bootstrap pipeline - [example](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-release/commit/c9be53307205765ebae48c18d00ef6260e596817?path=/eng/pipeline/source-build-release/steps/re-bootstrap.yml&version=GBmain&line=90&lineEnd=91&lineStartColumn=1&lineEndColumn=1&type=2&lineStyle=plain&_a=files).
   - The release validation will fail until the next source-build release. File an issue to update the artifacts used for the release validation after the next release.

1. **Complete the transition:**
   - Queue the re-bootstrap pipeline after the next successful CI build of the VMR
   - In the resulting PR, make the changes described in your tracking issue (Step 4)
   - Merge the resulting PR and close the tracking issue

### Case 2: OS Leg in VMR Produces Regular Artifact (Standard Update)

For distros not used in n-1 legs:

1. **Update VMR pipeline variables:**
   - Update the distro-specific variables to new version values

1. **Update SBRP Cleanup pipeline:**
   - If applicable, update default artifact name in the source-build-reference-packages clean up pipeline - [example](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages/pull/1284)

1. **Submit changes:**
   - Open a pull request with all the above changes
   - Queue a full build of the VMR to validate the changes

## Timing Guidelines for Distro Updates

1. Update `main` to the newer version one to two months prior to the GA/EOL date.
    This is done to flush out any issues and to avoid destabilizing the servicing
    branches.
1. At the GA/EOL date, update the servicing branches.
