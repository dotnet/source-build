**Prebuilts**

Prebuilts are dependencies that a repo has on binary files that are not built from source.  All packages included in the distro are built by the distro and the source requirements are inclusive of build tools and build dependencies. The default position for inclusion in a distro is no pre-built binaries though there are proper exceptional cases to bootstrap builds.

**Patches**

Patches are created in source-build when a repo's code doesn't build as-is. Patches are required to keep source-build moving forward and building on new product builds. As patches are created, issues are opened in the corresponding repo to incorporate the code and remove the patch.

**Repo BAR status**

The Build Asset Registry is used to inform source-build about what version of each repo we want to build.  Publishing to BAR is simple for Arcade repos.  We also have an example build that publishes to BAR without Arcade: https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages/blob/master/eng/common/templates/job/publish-build-assets.yml.

Not publishing to BAR, not planning to be:
- application-insights (not owned by us and doesn't change often)
- aspnet/common (obsolete)
- newtonsoft-json (not owned by us)

Not on Arcade or BAR:
- VSTest

On Arcade but not BAR:
- xliff-tasks (https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/issues/114)
