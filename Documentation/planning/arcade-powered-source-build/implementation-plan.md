# Source-build 5.0 Implementation Plan

To get each repo building with the new source-build 5.0 plan, [Arcade-Powered Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/tree/release/3.1/Documentation/planning/arcade-powered-source-build), the following stages will be accomplished.  Below, the repos are placed in a table representing the earliest dependencies are available and work can begin.  Stages can be completed in parallel, but stage 4 may depend on output from stage 6 from previous repos.  The following graph and table will be used to track progress for each repo.

## Stage descriptions:
  - **(1) Build from source 5.0**
    - Get repo building from source with 5.0 source in dotnet/source-build.
  - **(2) Input intermediate packages available**
    - Indicates upstream intermediate packages are available, and work on this repo can begin.
  - **(3) Merge patches & local build infra**
    - All source-build specific build parameters from `/repos/<reponame>.proj` in source-build repo moved to repo `/eng` directory.
    - Repo-specific patches are incorporated.
    - If necessary, create a dev branch to manage changes.
  - **(4) Merge CI, generate official build**
    - PR validation and Official Build CI jobs added to repo and run to generate intermediate package for repo.
  - **(5) Validate & merge dev branch into 5.0**
    - Build logs and intermediate package of an official build are reviewed and validated by source-build team.
    - Source-build changes are live for the repo in the `main`/`master` branch.
    - If a dev branch was created, it is merged into `main`/`master`.
    - The changes are ported to the branch for `5.0`.
  - **(6) Prebuilt baseline enforcement**
    - Prebuilt check baseline is narrowed down to necessary packages.
    - PR validation builds fail if new prebuilts are introduced.
