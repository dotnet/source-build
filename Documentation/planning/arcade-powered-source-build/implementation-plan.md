# Source-build 5.0 Implementation Plan

To get each repo building with the new source-build 5.0 plan, [Arcade-Powered Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/tree/release/3.1/Documentation/planning/arcade-powered-source-build), the following stages will be accomplished.  Below, the repos are placed in a table representing the earliest dependencies are available and work can begin.  Stages can be completed in parallel, but stage 4 may depend on output from stage 6 from previous repos.  The following graph and table will be used to track progress for each repo.

## Stage descriptions:
  - **(1) Build from Source 5.0** – Get repo building from source with 5.0 source in dotnet/source-build.
  - **(2) Patch Removal** – Incorporate patches required to build from source into the repo code base.
  - **(3) Move Build Params to Eng Dir** – Move all source-build specific build parameter from `/repos/<reponame>.proj` in source-build repo to repo `/eng` directory.
  - **(4) Input Intermediate Packages Available** – Indicates upstream intermediate packages are available, and work on this repo can begin.
  - **(5) Official build** – Build source-built intermediate packages in official build.
  - **(6) Source-build PR validation** – Add AzDO build jobs to PR validation to ensure build-from-source continues running without avoidable regressions.
  - **(7) Prebuilt check / enforcement** – Add a check to PR validation to ensure that no prebuilts are included when building repo.
