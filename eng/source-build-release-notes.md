You can build $RELEASE_NAME from the repository by cloning the release tag `$TAG` and following the build instructions in the [main README.md](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/$TAG/README.md#building).

Alternatively, you can build from the sources attached to this release directly.
More information on this process can be found in the [dotnet/dotnet repository](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/$TAG/README.md#building-from-released-sources).
