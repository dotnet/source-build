Subject: [PATCH 15/19] Don't use RTMVersion in source-build

This seems like it would bring in prebuilts, and more directly, causes:

  Detected package downgrade: System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs from 5.0.1 to 5.0.0. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.
   RepoTasks -> NuGet.Packaging 5.8.0-rc.6930 -> System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs (>= 5.0.1)
   RepoTasks -> System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs (>= 5.0.0)
