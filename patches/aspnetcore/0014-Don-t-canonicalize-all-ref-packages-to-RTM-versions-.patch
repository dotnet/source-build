Subject: [PATCH 14/19] Don't canonicalize all ref packages to RTM versions for
 source-build. This is because we turn on BuildAllPackages in runtime since we
 don't use the previous version's prebuilt bits. This target makes the version
 numbers mismatch, resulting in errors like error MSB3106: Assembly strong
 name
 "/home/chris/dotnet_source-build/packages/restored/system.io.pipelines/5.0.0/ref/net5.0/System.I
 O.Pipelines.dll" is either a path which could not be found or it is a full
 assembly name which is badly formed.

because while 5.0.x was restored properly, this target changes the reference in between restoring and building.
