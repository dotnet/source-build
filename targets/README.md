Adding a build targets is analogous to defining a class in C++ - define the repository in the targets.metadata, and implement the targets files appropriately (add an import to the top of the targets.metadata if you create a new one).

If your repository implements the Core-Repository interface, then feel free to add it to the build-core.targets.
