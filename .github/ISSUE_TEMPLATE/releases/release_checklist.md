  .NET 6.0 Release Checklist

  To start the checklist for a new release:
  - If it's an internal release, open a new issue in dotnet/core-eng (private repo).
    - Otherwise, open a new issue in dotnet/source-build.
  - Delete lines starting with [Internal] if running a non-internal release.
  - Delete lines starting with [Non-Internal] if running an internal release.

<!-- Issue Title: --> Source-build {runtime-version} / {sdk-version} {Month} {Year} Servicing

# {runtime-version} / {sdk-version}

1. - [ ] Create a page at ".NET Core A&D" OneNote -> "Servicing" section -> "Retrospective" -> "{Month} {YYYY}" to take ongoing notes on problems with the process, workarounds, and fixes.
      - This is useful to make sure context is available to review later. It may end up blank if the release goes very smoothly.
      - There are other notes on servicing in this OneNote. It may be useful to review if something goes wrong to see if it's been fixed before.
      - [Non-Internal] File GitHub issues as you encounter problems, and link to them from the notes. Provide info in the issue rather than in the notes.
1. - [ ] Retrieve dotnet/installer commit sha from internal communications for the release.
1. - [ ] Ensure the official installer and tarball builds have completed for the release's commit sha.
     - [ ] [Installer](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=286) (internal link)
       - [ ] Retrieve the source tarball artifact - `BlobArtifacts/dotnet-sdk-source-6.0.xxx.tar.gz`
     - [ ] [Tarball](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=1011) (internal link)
1. - [ ] [Internal] Gather smoke-test prereqs and package in dotnet-smoke-test-prereqs-6.0.101.tar.gz.
     - [ ] Retrieve the smoke-test prereqs artifact from [Tarball](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=1011) (internal link) - `Build Tarball CentOS7-Offline_Artifacts/dotnet-smoke-test-prereqs.6.0.xxx.tar.gz`
     - [ ] Manually add `microsoft.net.runtime.monoaotcompiler.task::6.0.x` by running `dotnet workload install macos` or manually downloading package. [Automation tracking issue](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2774) for this step.
1. - [ ] [Internal] Upload source and smoke-test-prereqs tarball to dotnetclimsrc storage account.
1. - [ ] Notify partners of release.  Include info about how certain we are that this will be the final Microsoft build.
     - [Internal] Send the dotnetclimsrc tarball links to partners.
         - Never overwrite a tarball. At least change the blob storage virtual dir to represent a new build. This can help avoid timing issues and make it more obvious if stale links were accidentally re-sent rather than new ones.
     - [Non-Internal] Send the dotnet/installer commit sha along w/link to publicly built source tarball.  Link to the public instructions for building source-build.
1. - [ ] SYNC POINT: Wait for Microsoft build release.
1. - [ ] Update tarball artifacts w/previous release.
     - [ ] global.json
       - [Automation tracking issue](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2632) for this step.
     - [ ] Previous source-built artifacts
1. - [ ] Clean up retrospective notes if necessary.
